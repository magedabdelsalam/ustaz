## Try These Commands to See Intelligent Subject Generation

### 1. **Start Your First Subject**
```
Chat: "I need help with solving linear equations"
```
**Expected:** Creates "Linear Algebra" subject with 5% progress

### 2. **Continue Learning Same Topic**
```
Chat: "Can you explain how to solve for x in 2x + 5 = 15?"
Chat: "What about more complex linear equations?"
```
**Expected:** Progress increases to 15%, stays in same subject

### 3. **Switch to New Topic**
```
Chat: "Now I want to learn about calculus derivatives"
```
**Expected:** Creates new "Derivatives" subject, previous subject becomes inactive

### 4. **Explicit Topic Change**
```
Chat: "Let's move on to geometry basics"
```
**Expected:** Creates "Geometry Concepts" subject

### 5. **Test Content Generation**
