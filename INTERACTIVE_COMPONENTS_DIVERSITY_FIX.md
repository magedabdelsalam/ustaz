# Interactive Components Diversity Fix

## Problem
When users clicked "Next Problem", "Next Question", or "Next Exercise" buttons in interactive components, the system kept generating the same type of content instead of providing variety.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive content diversity system that tracks recently generated content types and ensures variety when users request "next" content.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatPane.tsx - Core Diversity System
**File**: `src/components/ChatPane.tsx`

#### Added Content Variety Tracking
- Added `recentContentTypes` state to track last 3 content types
- Added `MAX_RECENT_TYPES = 3` constant
- Added `getDiverseContentType()` function that:
  - Takes requested action and recent types as input
  - Filters out recently used types to ensure variety
  - Returns diverse content type based on action context
- Added `updateRecentContentTypes()` function to maintain the tracking list

#### Updated Content Generation Logic
- Modified content type selection for `next_question`, `next_exercise`, and `next_problem` actions
- Now uses diversity system instead of always generating same type
- Added logging for debugging content variety decisions

#### Content Type Mapping by Action
- **next_question**: Prioritizes quiz-like content (`quiz`, `fill-blank`, `concept-card`, `explainer`)
- **next_exercise**: Prioritizes interactive practice (`fill-blank`, `step-solver`, `quiz`, `drag-drop`, `concept-card`)
- **next_problem**: Provides varied problem-solving content (`step-solver`, `quiz`, `fill-blank`, `concept-card`, `explainer`)

### 2. ProgressQuiz.tsx - Added New Quiz Option
**File**: `src/components/interactive/ProgressQuiz.tsx`

#### Added New Quiz Functionality
- Added `handleNewQuiz()` function that calls `onInteraction('next_question', ...)` for diversity
- Added "New Quiz" button alongside existing "Retake Quiz" button
- Provides users with both options: try same quiz again OR get different content

### 3. DragAndDrop.tsx - Added New Exercise Option
**File**: `src/components/interactive/DragAndDrop.tsx`

#### Added New Exercise Functionality
- Added `handleNewExercise()` function that calls `onInteraction('next_exercise', ...)` for diversity
- Updated button layout to show both "New Exercise" and "Try Again" options
- Provides users with choice between new content or retrying current exercise

### 4. TextHighlighter.tsx - Added New Text Option
**File**: `src/components/interactive/TextHighlighter.tsx`

#### Added New Text Functionality
- Added `handleNewText()` function that calls `onInteraction('next_exercise', ...)` for diversity
- Added "New Text" button alongside "Try Again" button in results section
- Provides users with option to get new highlighting text or retry current one

### 5. Existing Components Already Had Diversity
The following components already had proper "Next" buttons using the diversity system:

#### MultipleChoice.tsx
- ✅ Has "Next Question" button calling `onInteraction('next_question', ...)`
- ✅ "Try Again" button only resets current question (appropriate)

#### FillInTheBlank.tsx
- ✅ Has "Next Exercise" button calling `onInteraction('next_exercise', ...)`
- ✅ "Try Again" button only resets current exercise (appropriate)

#### StepByStepSolver.tsx
- ✅ Has "Next Problem" button calling `onInteraction('next_problem', ...)`
- ✅ Already fixed to not send AI response on completion

#### ConceptCard.tsx
- ✅ Has three action buttons that work with diversity:
  - "Explain Further" → `concept_expanded`
  - "More Examples" → `examples_requested`
  - "Practice This" → `ready_for_next`

#### Explainer.tsx
- ✅ Has three action buttons that work with diversity:
  - "Ask Question" → `question_requested`
  - "More Detail" → `detail_expanded`
  - "Continue" → `ready_for_next`

## How It Works

### Content Variety Flow
1. User clicks any "Next" button in an interactive component
2. Component calls `onInteraction()` with appropriate action (`next_question`, `next_exercise`, `next_problem`)
3. ChatPane receives the action and calls `getDiverseContentType()`
4. System checks recently generated content types (last 3)
5. Filters out recently used types from available options
6. Selects random type from remaining diverse options
7. If all types were recently used, resets and allows any type
8. Generates new content with selected diverse type
9. Updates recent content types tracker

### Action-to-Content Mapping
- **next_question** → Quiz-like content (quiz, fill-blank, concept-card, explainer)
- **next_exercise** → Interactive practice (fill-blank, step-solver, quiz, drag-drop, concept-card)
- **next_problem** → Problem-solving content (step-solver, quiz, fill-blank, concept-card, explainer)

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ No more repetitive content types
- ✅ Varied learning experiences
- ✅ Choice between new content or retrying current content
- ✅ Maintains engagement through variety

### For System
- ✅ Intelligent content distribution
- ✅ Tracks and prevents repetition
- ✅ Context-aware content selection
- ✅ Maintains educational progression

## Testing
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript types are correct
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Backward compatible with all existing components

## Future Enhancements
- Could extend tracking to more than 3 recent types
- Could add user preferences for content types
- Could implement difficulty-based variety
- Could add analytics on content type effectiveness
